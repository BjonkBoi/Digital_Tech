    Dear parents and guardians of Troop 116 G/B I am here to invite you to up and coming event. The troop is hosting a court of honor to recongise all of the scouts achievments within the past half year. The court of honor is on Febuary 13th at 2pm at the town hall. We are also planning to do canned drive, so a donation of 1 or 2 non-perishables would be greatly appreciated. 

    Thanks, 
    Aidan Hall, Assistant Patrol Leader of Troop 116B
